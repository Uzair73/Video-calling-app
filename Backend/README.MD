The video calling backend is designed to facilitate real-time communication between users. It leverages WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology to enable direct peer-to-peer video and audio calls through the web browser without the need for any external plugins or applications.

Key Components:
- **Signaling Server**: This component is responsible for the initial handshake between users wanting to establish a video call. It helps in exchanging necessary metadata and network information (like IP addresses and ports) between peers to set up the direct connection.
- **STUN/TURN Servers**: STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers are used to overcome network address translation (NAT) issues that might prevent peers from establishing a direct connection. While STUN attempts to find the direct route, TURN serves as a relay server in scenarios where direct communication is not possible.
- **Media Server (Optional)**: For applications requiring more advanced features like call recording, multi-party calls, or live streaming, a media server can be integrated into the architecture. It processes and forwards media streams to support these functionalities.

Security Measures:
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Users are authenticated using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth to ensure that only authorized users can initiate or join a video call.

This backend system is built with a focus on reliability, scalability, and security, providing a seamless video calling experience for users.
